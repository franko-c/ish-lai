        <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>There are so many image formats available - though some in particular, are really good for using on the web. What are they?</p>

        <h2>JPGs</h2>
        <img src="../ish-lai/images/mochi.jpg" alt="A cartoon style depiction of a mochi ball. It is smiling pleasantly, and it has notably rosy cheeks!" height="" width="">
        <p>The JPG format is useful for when you want to show off a high quality image, or one with a large colour palette, whilst keeping the size down. JPGs don't allow for transparent pixels. They're great for photos and images with gradients in them.</p>

        <h2>GIFs</h2>
        <img src="../ish-lai/images/mochi.gif" alt="An animated, cartoon mochi ball. It is smiling and bouncing up and down on the spot." height="" width="">
        <p>GIFs are the washed up celebrities of internet image formats...they are 'the go-to option for simple animations...' and support transparency as a binary option - that means they are either see-through, or not. Don't use them for photos!</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, they were everywhere and used by everyone; Facebook posts and comments, in e-mails, on forums and to this day there exists a Reddit community dedicated to producing only the highest quality animated images.</p>

        <h2>PNGs</h2>
        <img src="../ish-lai/images/mochi.png" alt="" height="" width="">
        <p>
            PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo or animated. For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don't have color palette limitations. This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.

        <h2>SVGs</h2>
        <img src="../ish-lai/images/mochi.svg" alt="" height="100" width="100">
        <img src="../ish-lai/images/mochi.svg" alt="" height="150" width="150">
        <img src="../ish-lai/images/mochi.svg" alt="" height="200" width="200">
        <p>
            SVGs are genuinely awesome in that they are vector based - which means they can be scaled up or down to any size and they'll look <em>just as good, without loss of quality!</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This property makes SVGs awesome for <strong>responsive design.</strong>, as well as for icons, logos and pretty much anything that's not a photo. If you can get your image as an SVG - use it!</p>
        <p>
            In my experience, they're not as popular as the other formats listed, although they are infinitely more useful, due to the mobile-first approach that we're seeing grow in popularity.
